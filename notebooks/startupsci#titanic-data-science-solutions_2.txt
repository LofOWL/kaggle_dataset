Titanic Data Science Solutions
This notebook is companion to the book Data Science Solutions. The notebook walks us through a typical workflow for solving data science competitions at sites like Kaggle.
There are several excellent notebooks to study data science competition entries. However many will skip some of the explanation on how the solution is developed as these notebooks are developed by experts for experts. The objective of this notebook is to follow a step-by-step workflow, explaining each step and rationale for every decision we take during solution development.
Workflow stages
The competition solution workflow goes through seven stages described in the Data Science Solutions book's sample chapter online here.
Question or problem definition.
Acquire training and testing data.
Wrangle, prepare, cleanse the data.
Analyze, identify patterns, and explore the data.
Model, predict and solve the problem.
Visualize, report, and present the problem solving steps and final solution.
Supply or submit the results.
The workflow indicates general sequence of how each stage may follow the other. However there are use cases with exceptions.
We may combine mulitple workflow stages. We may analyze by visualizing data.
Perform a stage earlier than indicated. We may analyze data before and after wrangling.
Perform a stage multiple times in our workflow. Visualize stage may be used multiple times.
Drop a stage altogether. We may not need supply stage to productize or service enable our dataset for a competition.
Question and problem definition
Competition sites like Kaggle define the problem to solve or questions to ask while providing the datasets for training your data science model and testing the model results against a test dataset. The question or problem definition for Titanic Survival competition is described here at Kaggle.
Knowing from a training set of samples listing passengers who survived or did not survive the Titanic disaster, can our model determine based on a given test dataset not containing the survival information, if these passengers in the test dataset survived or not.
We may also want to develop some early understanding about the domain of our problem. This is described on the Kaggle competition description page here. Here are the highlights to note.
On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg, killing 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew. Translated 32% survival rate.
One of the reasons that the shipwreck led to such loss of life was that there were not enough lifeboats for the passengers and crew.
Although there was some element of luck involved in surviving the sinking, some groups of people were more likely to survive than others, such as women, children, and the upper-class.
Workflow goals
The data science solutions workflow solves for seven major goals.
Classifying. We may want to classify or categorize our samples. We may also want to understand the implications or correlation of different classes with our solution goal.
Correlating. One can approach the problem based on available features within the training dataset. Which features within the dataset contribute significantly to our solution goal? Statistically speaking is there a correlation among a feature and solution goal? As the feature values change does the solution state change as well, and visa-versa? This can be tested both for numerical and categorical features in the given dataset. We may also want to determine correlation among features other than survival for subsequent goals and workflow stages. Correlating certain features may help in creating, completing, or correcting features.
Converting. For modeling stage, one needs to prepare the data. Depending on the choice of model algorithm one may require all features to be converted to numerical equivalent values. So for instance converting text categorical values to numeric values.
Completing. Data preparation may also require us to estimate any missing values within a feature. Model algorithms may work best when there are no missing values.
Correcting. We may also analyze the given training dataset for errors or possibly innacurate values within features and try to corrent these values or exclude the samples containing the errors. One way to do this is to detect any outliers among our samples or features. We may also completely discard a feature if it is not contribting to the analysis or may significantly skew the results.
Creating. Can we create new features based on an existing feature or a set of features, such that the new feature follows the correlation, conversion, completeness goals.
Charting. How to select the right visualization plots and charts depending on nature of the data and the solution goals. A good start is to read the Tableau paper on Which chart or graph is right for you?.

Acquire data
The Python Pandas packages helps us work with our datasets. We start by acquiring the training and testing datasets into Pandas DataFrames.
In [2]:
# read titanic training & test csv files as a pandas DataFrame
train_df = pd.read_csv('../input/train.csv')
test_df = pd.read_csv('../input/test.csv')
Analyze by describing data
Pandas also helps describe the datasets answering following questions early in our project.
Which features are available in the dataset?
Noting the feature names for directly manipulating or analyzing these. These feature names are described on the Kaggle data page here.
In [3]:
print(train_df.columns.values)
['PassengerId' 'Survived' 'Pclass' 'Name' 'Sex' 'Age' 'SibSp' 'Parch'
 'Ticket' 'Fare' 'Cabin' 'Embarked']
Which features are categorical?
These values classify the samples into sets of similar samples. Within categorical features are the values nominal, ordinal, ratio, or interval based? Among other things this helps us select the appropriate plots for visualization.
Categorical: Survived, Sex, and Embarked. Ordinal: Pclass.
Which features are numerical?
Which features are numerical? These values change from sample to sample. Within numerical features are the values discrete, continuous, or timeseries based? Among other things this helps us select the appropriate plots for visualization.
Continous: Age, Fare. Discrete: SibSp, Parch.

Which features are mixed data types?
Numerical, alphanumeric data within same feature. These are candidates for correcting goal.
Ticket is a mix of numeric and alphanumeric data types. Cabin is alphanumeric.
Which features may contain errors or typos?
This is harder to review for a large dataset, however reviewing a few samples from a smaller dataset may just tell us outright, which features may require correcting.
Name feature may contain errors or typos as there are several ways used to describe a name including titles, round brackets, and quotes used for alternative or short names.

Which features contain blank, null or empty values?
These will require correcting.

Cabin > Age are incomplete in case of test dataset.
What are the data types for various features?
Helping us during converting goal.
Seven features are integer or floats. Six in case of test dataset.
Five features are strings (object).

What is the distribution of numerical feature values across the samples?
This helps us determine, among other early insights, how representative is the training dataset of the actual problem domain.
Total samples are 891 or 40% of the actual number of passengers on board the Titanic (2,224).
Survived is a categorical feature with 0 or 1 values.
Around 38% samples survived representative of the actual survival rate.
Most passengers (> 75%) did not travel with parents or children.
More than 35% passengers had a sibling on board.
Fares varied significantly with few passengers (<1%) paying as high as $512.
Few elderly passengers (<1%) within age range 65-80.

What is the distribution of categorical features?
Names are unique across the dataset (count=unique=891)
Sex variable as two possible values with 65% male (top=male, freq=577/count=891).
Cabin values have several dupicates across samples. Alternatively several passengers shared a cabin.
Embarked takes three possible values. S port used by most passengers (top=S)
Ticket feature has high ratio (22%) of duplicate values (unique=681). Possibly an error as two passengers may not travel on the same ticket.

Assumtions based on data analysis
We arrive at following assumptions based on data analysis done so far. We may validate these assumptions further before taking appropriate actions.
Completing.
We may want to complete Age feature as it is definitely correlated to survival.
We may want to complete the Embarked feature as it may also correlate with survival or another important feature.
Correcting.
Ticket feature may be dropped from our analysis as it contains high ratio of duplicates (22%) and there may not be a correlation between Ticket and survival.
Cabin feature may be dropped as it is highly incomplete or contains many null values both in training and test dataset.
PassengerId may be dropped from training dataset as it does not contribute to survival.
Name feature is relatively non-standard, may not contribute directly to survival, so maybe dropped.
Creating.
We may want to create a new feature called Family based on Parch and SibSp to get total count of family members on board.
We may want to engineer the Name feature to extract Title as a new feature.
We may want to create new feature for Age bands. This turns a continous numerical feature into an ordinal categorical feature.
We may also want to create a Fare range feature if it helps our analysis.
Correlating.
Does port of embarkation (Embarked) correlate with survival?
Does fare paid (range) correlate with survival?
We may also add to our assumptions based on the problem description noted earlier.
Classifying.
Women (Sex=female) were more likely to have survived.
Children (Age<?) were more likely to have survived.
The upper-class passengers (Pclass=1) were more likely to have survived.
Analyze by visualizing data
Now we can start confirming some of our assumptions using visualizations for analyzing the data.
Correlating numerical features
Let us start by understanding correlations between numerical features and our solution goal (Survived).
A histogram chart is useful for analyzing continous numerical variables like Age where banding or ranges will help identify useful patterns. The histogram can indicate distribution of samples using automatically defined bins or equally ranged bands. This helps us answer questions relating to specific bands (Did infants have better survival rate?)
Note that x-axis in historgram visualizations represents the count of samples or passengers.
Observations.
Infants (Age <=4) had high survival rate.
Oldest passengers (Age = 80) survived.
Large number of 15-25 year olds did not survive.
Most passengers are in 15-35 age range.
Decisions.
This simple analysis confirms our assumptions as decisions for subsequent workflow stages.
We should consider Age (our assumption classifying #2) in our model training.
Complete the Age feature for null values (completing #1).
In [9]:
g = sns.FacetGrid(train_df, col='Survived')
g.map(plt.hist, 'Age', bins=20)
Out[9]:
<seaborn.axisgrid.FacetGrid at 0x7f04dcb92b70>
We can combine multiple features for identifying correlations using a single plot. This can be done with numerical and categorical features which have numeric values.
Observations.
Pclass=3 had most passengers, however most did not survive. Confirms our classifying assumption #2.
Infant passengers in Pclass=2 mostly survived. Further qualifies our classifying assumption #2.
Most passengers in Pclass=1 survived. Confirms our classifying assumption #3.
Pclass varies in terms of Age distribution of passengers.
Decisions.
Consider Pclass for model training.
In [10]:
grid = sns.FacetGrid(train_df, col='Pclass', hue='Survived', size=2.2, aspect=1.2, legend_out=False)
grid.map(plt.hist, 'Age', alpha=.5, bins=20)
grid.add_legend();
Correlating categorical features
Now we can correlate categorical features with our solution goal.
Observations.
Female passengers had much better survival rate than males. Confirms classifying (#1).
Exception in Embarked=C where males had higher survival rate.
Males had better survival rate in Pclass=3 when compared with Pclass=2 for C and Q ports. Completing (#2).
Ports of embarkation have varying survival rates for Pclass=3 and among male passengers. Correlating (#1).
Decisions.
Add Sex feature to model training.
Complete and add Embarked feature to model training.
In [11]:
grid = sns.FacetGrid(train_df, col='Embarked', size=2.2, aspect=1.2, legend_out=False)
grid.map(sns.pointplot, 'Pclass', 'Survived', 'Sex', palette='deep')
grid.add_legend()
Out[11]:
<seaborn.axisgrid.FacetGrid at 0x7f04da06ecc0>
Correlating categorical and numerical features
We may also want to correlate categorical features (with non-numeric values) and numeric features. We can consider correlating Embarked (Categorical non-numeric), Sex (Categorical non-numeric), Fare (Numeric continuous), with Survived (Categorical numeric).
Observations.
Higher fare paying passengers had better survival. Confirms our assumption for creating (#4) fare ranges.
Port of embarkation correlates with survival rates. Comfirms correlating (#1) and completing (#2).
Decisions.
Consider banding Fare feature.
In [12]:
grid = sns.FacetGrid(train_df, col='Embarked', hue='Survived', palette={0: 'k', 1: 'w'}, size=2.2, aspect=1.2, legend_out=False)

grid.add_legend()
Out[12]:
<seaborn.axisgrid.FacetGrid at 0x7f04f4c6b0b8>
Wrangle data
We have collected several assumptions and decisions regarding our datasets and solution requirements. So far we did not have to change a single feature or value to arrive at these. Let us now execute our decisions and assumptions for correcting, creating, and completing goals.
Correcting by dropping features
This is a good starting goal to execute. By dropping features we are dealing with fewer data points. Speeds up our notebook and eases the analysis.
Based on our assumptions and decisions we want to drop the Cabin (correcting #2) and Ticket (correcting #1) features.
Note that where applicable we perform operations on both training and testing datasets together to stay consistent.
In [13]:
train_df = train_df.drop(['Ticket', 'Cabin'], axis=1)
test_df = test_df.drop(['Ticket', 'Cabin'], axis=1)
Creating new feature extracting from existing
We want to analyze if Name feature can be engineered to extract titles and test correlation between titles and survival, before dropping Name and PassengerId features.
In the following code we extract Title feature using regular expressions. The RegEx pattern (\w+\.) matches the first word which ends with a dot character within Name feature. The expand=False flag returns a DataFrame.
Observations.
When we plot Title, Age, and Survived, we note the following observations.
Most titles band Age groups accurately. For example: Master title has Age mean of 5 years.
Survival among Title Age bands varies slightly.
Certain titles mostly survived (Mme, Lady, Sir) or did not (Don, Rev, Jonkheer).
Decision.
We decide to retain the new Title feature for model training.
In [14]:
train_df['Title'] = train_df.Name.str.extract('(\w+\.)', expand=False)
sns.barplot(hue="Survived", x="Age", y="Title", data=train_df, ci=False)
Out[14]:
<matplotlib.axes._subplots.AxesSubplot at 0x7f04d9ab6be0>
Let us extract the Title feature for the training dataset as well.
Then we can safely drop the Name feature from training and testing datasets and the PassengerId feature from the training dataset.
In [15]:
test_df['Title'] = test_df.Name.str.extract('(\w+\.)', expand=False)

train_df = train_df.drop(['Name', 'PassengerId'], axis=1)
test_df = test_df.drop(['Name'], axis=1)
test_df.describe(include=['O'])
Out[15]:
Sex Embarked Title
count 418 418 418
unique 2 3 9
top male S Mr.
freq 266 270 240
Converting a categorical feature
Now we can convert features which contain strings to numerical values. This is required by most model algorithms. Doing so will also help us in achieving the feature completing goal.
Let us start by converting Sex feature to a new feature called Gender where female=1 and male=0.
In [16]:
train_df['Gender'] = train_df['Sex'].map( {'female': 1, 'male': 0} ).astype(int)
train_df.loc[:, ['Gender', 'Sex']].head()
Out[16]:
Gender Sex
0 0 male
1 1 female
2 1 female
3 1 female
4 0 male
We do this both for training and test datasets.
In [17]:
test_df['Gender'] = test_df['Sex'].map( {'female': 1, 'male': 0} ).astype(int)
test_df.loc[:, ['Gender', 'Sex']].head()
Out[17]:
Gender Sex
0 0 male
1 1 female
2 0 male
3 0 male
4 1 female
We can now drop the Sex feature from our datasets.
In [18]:
train_df = train_df.drop(['Sex'], axis=1)
test_df = test_df.drop(['Sex'], axis=1)
train_df.head()
Out[18]:
Survived Pclass Age SibSp Parch Fare Embarked Title Gender

1 1 1 38.0 1 0 71.2833 C Mrs. 1
2 1 3 26.0 0 0 7.9250 S Miss. 1
3 1 1 35.0 1 0 53.1000 S Mrs. 1
4 0 3 35.0 0 0 8.0500 S Mr. 0
Completing a numerical continuous feature
Now we should start estimating and completing features with missing or null values. We will first do this for the Age feature.
We can consider three methods to complete a numerical continuous feature.
A simple way is to generate random numbers between mean and standard deviation.
More accurate way of guessing missing values is to use other correlated features. In our case we note correlation among Age, Gender, and Pclass. Guess Age values using median values for Age across sets of Pclass and Gender feature combinations. So, median Age for Pclass=1 and Gender=0, Pclass=1 and Gender=1, and so on...
Combine methods 1 and 2. So instead of guessing age values based on median, use random numbers between mean and standard deviation, based on sets of Pclass and Gender combinations.
Method 1 and 3 will introduce random noise into our models. The results from multiple executions might vary. We will prefer method 2.
In [19]:
grid = sns.FacetGrid(train_df, col='Pclass', hue='Gender', size=2.2, aspect=1.2, legend_out=False)
grid.map(plt.hist, 'Age', alpha=.5, bins=20)
grid.add_legend();
Let us start by preparing an empty array to contain guessed Age values based on Pclass x Gender combinations.
In [20]:
guess_ages = np.zeros((2,3))
guess_ages
Out[20]:
array([[ 0.,  0.,  0.],
       [ 0.,  0.,  0.]])
Now we iterate over Gender (0 or 1) and Pclass (1, 2, 3) to calculate guessed values of Age for the six combinations.
Note that we also tried creating the AgeFill feature using method 3 and realized during model stage that the correlation coeffficient of AgeFill is better when compared with the method 2.

We can now drop the Age feature from our datasets.

Create new feature combining existing features
We can create a new feature for FamilySize which combines Parch and SibSp. This will enable us to drop Parch and SibSp from our datasets.
Note that we commented out this code as we realized during model stage that the combined feature is reducing the confidence score of our dataset instead of improving it. The correlation score of separate Parch feature is also better than combined FamilySize feature.
In [25]:
# Logistic Regression Score is 0.81032547699214363
# Parch correlation is -0.065878 and SibSp correlation is -0.370618

# Decision: Retain Parch and SibSp as separate features

# Logistic Regression Score is 0.80808080808080807
# FamilySize correlation is -0.233974

# train_df['FamilySize'] = train_df['SibSp'] + train_df['Parch']
# test_df['FamilySize'] = test_df['SibSp'] + test_df['Parch']
# train_df.loc[:, ['Parch', 'SibSp', 'FamilySize']].head(10)
In [26]:
# train_df = train_df.drop(['Parch', 'SibSp'], axis=1)
# test_df = test_df.drop(['Parch', 'SibSp'], axis=1)
# train_df.head()
We can also create an artificial feature combining Pclass and AgeFill.
In [27]:
test_df['Age*Class'] = test_df.AgeFill * test_df.Pclass
train_df['Age*Class'] = train_df.AgeFill * train_df.Pclass
train_df.loc[:, ['Age*Class', 'AgeFill', 'Pclass']].head(10)

Completing a categorical feature
Embarked feature takes S, Q, C values based on port of embarkation. Our training dataset has two missing values. We simply fill these with the most common occurance.
In [28]:
freq_port = train_df.Embarked.dropna().mode()[0]
freq_port
Out[28]:
'S'
In [29]:
train_df['EmbarkedFill'] = train_df['Embarked']
train_df.loc[train_df['Embarked'].isnull(), 'EmbarkedFill'] = freq_port
train_df[train_df['Embarked'].isnull()][['Embarked','EmbarkedFill']].head(10)
Out[29]:
Embarked EmbarkedFill
61 NaN S
829 NaN S
We can now drop the Embarked feature from our datasets.
In [30]:
test_df['EmbarkedFill'] = test_df['Embarked']
train_df = train_df.drop(['Embarked'], axis=1)
test_df = test_df.drop(['Embarked'], axis=1)
train_df.head()
Out[30]:
Survived Pclass SibSp Parch Fare Title Gender AgeFill Age*Class EmbarkedFill
0 0 3 1 0 7.2500 Mr. 0 22.0 66.0 S

4 0 3 0 0 8.0500 Mr. 0 35.0 105.0 S
Converting categorical feature to numeric
We can now convert the EmbarkedFill feature by creating a new numeric Port feature.
In [31]:
Ports = list(enumerate(np.unique(train_df['EmbarkedFill'])))
Ports_dict = { name : i for i, name in Ports }              
train_df['Port'] = train_df.EmbarkedFill.map( lambda x: Ports_dict[x]).astype(int)

Ports = list(enumerate(np.unique(test_df['EmbarkedFill'])))
Ports_dict = { name : i for i, name in Ports }
test_df['Port'] = test_df.EmbarkedFill.map( lambda x: Ports_dict[x]).astype(int)

train_df[['EmbarkedFill', 'Port']].head(10)
Out[31]:
EmbarkedFill Port
0 S 2
1 C 0
2 S 2
3 S 2
4 S 2
5 Q 1
6 S 2
7 S 2
8 S 2
9 C 0
Similarly we can convert the Title feature to numeric enumeration TitleBand banding age groups with titles.
In [32]:
Titles = list(enumerate(np.unique(train_df['Title'])))
Titles_dict = { name : i for i, name in Titles }           
train_df['TitleBand'] = train_df.Title.map( lambda x: Titles_dict[x]).astype(int)

Titles = list(enumerate(np.unique(test_df['Title'])))
Titles_dict = { name : i for i, name in Titles }           
test_df['TitleBand'] = test_df.Title.map( lambda x: Titles_dict[x]).astype(int)

train_df[['Title', 'TitleBand']].head(10)
Out[32]:
Title TitleBand
0 Mr. 12
1 Mrs. 13
2 Miss. 9
3 Mrs. 13
4 Mr. 12
5 Mr. 12
6 Mr. 12
7 Master. 8
8 Mrs. 13
9 Mrs. 13
Now we can safely drop the EmbarkedFill and Title features. We this we now have a dataset that only contains numerical values, a requirement for the model stage in our workflow.
In [33]:
train_df = train_df.drop(['EmbarkedFill', 'Title'], axis=1)
test_df = test_df.drop(['EmbarkedFill', 'Title'], axis=1)
train_df.head()
Out[33]:
Survived Pclass SibSp Parch Fare Gender AgeFill Age*Class Port TitleBand
0 0 3 1 0 7.2500 0 22.0 66.0 2 12
1 1 1 1 0 71.2833 1 38.0 38.0 0 13
2 1 3 0 0 7.9250 1 26.0 78.0 2 9
3 1 1 1 0 53.1000 1 35.0 35.0 2 13
4 0 3 0 0 8.0500 0 35.0 105.0 2 12
Quick completing and converting a numeric feature
We can now complete the Fare feature for single missing value in test dataset using mode to get the value that occurs most frequently for this feature. We do this in a single line of code.
Note that we are not creating an intermediate new feature or doing any further analysis for correlation to guess missing feature as we are replacing only a single value. The completion goal achieves desired requirement for model algorithm to operate on non-null values.
We may also want round off the fare to two decimals as it represents currency.
In [34]:
test_df['Fare'].fillna(test_df['Fare'].dropna().median(), inplace=True)

train_df['Fare'] = train_df['Fare'].round(2)
test_df['Fare'] = test_df['Fare'].round(2)

test_df.head(10)
Out[34]:

Model, predict and solve
Now we are ready to train a model and predict the required solution.
In [35]:
X_train = train_df.drop("Survived", axis=1)
Y_train = train_df["Survived"]
X_test  = test_df.drop("PassengerId", axis=1).copy()
X_train.shape, Y_train.shape, X_test.shape
Out[35]:
((891, 9), (891,), (418, 9))
Logistic Regression is a useful model to run early in the workflow.
In [36]:
# Logistic Regression

logreg = LogisticRegression()
logreg.fit(X_train, Y_train)
Y_pred = logreg.predict(X_test)
logreg.score(X_train, Y_train)
Out[36]:
0.81032547699214363
We can use Logistic Regression to validate our assumptions and decisions for feature creating and completing goals. This can be done by calculating the correlation coefficient for all features as these relate to survival.
Gender as expected has highest corrlation with Survived.
Surprisingly Fare ranks higher than Age.
Our decision to extract TitleBand feature from name is a good one.
The artificial feature Age*Class scores well against existing features.
We tried creating a feature combining Parch and SibSp into FamilySize. Parch ended up with better correlation coefficient and FamilySize reduced our LogisticRegression confidence score.
Another surprise is that Pclass contributes least to our model, even worse than Port of embarkation, or the artificial feature Age*Class.
In [37]:
# get Correlation Coefficient for each feature using Logistic Regression
coeff_df = pd.DataFrame(train_df.columns.delete(0))

Our submission to the competition site Kaggle results in scoring 3,883 of 6,082 competition entries. This result is indicative while the competition is running. This result only accounts for part of the submission dataset. Not bad for our first attempt. Any suggestions to improve our score are most welcome.
